# Homegrown In(ter)dependence

<h2 class="font-italic">How can we reduce our dependence on tech giants and increase our virtual self-sufficiency?</h2>

Homegrown In(ter)dependence is a project practising digital independence. Rebelling against gigantic tech cooperations, it aims to practise self-reliance in virtual spaces by researching and developing tools that can be built in an individual's home.

## Our Data in the Hands of a Few

Human activities on the Internet heavily focus on interchanging information and communication. But only 4 companies have 67% of the entire world’s cloud data: Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Alibaba. On December 2021, Amazon's three big outages influenced the entire digital ecosystem, the largest social media platforms, banks, delivery services, and other systems using them. We lost access to thousands of photos, memories, and our entire careers presented online, and it created worldly chaos.
Unreliable access to our information is not the only issue in the data-driven society. The collected data from communication, such as comments, emails, and messenger messages are being sold and used for attention economy, manipulating politics, and surveillance.

## The Wake-Up Call!

As a beginning of realisation, we attempted to build a home server at our studio RGBdog to gain our control back. However, we found out it was all written for the users who already understand, and they were scattered in pieces on the internet. It was incredibly difficult to even find the time to collect all information, verify them, and take action. This large knowledge gap worried us greatly as our digital data is one of the vital sources in society.

## Independence & Interdependence = In(ter)dependence

Therefore, with this project, we decided to research, build and share homemade tools that extend our digital agency. This starts as a personal server that runs from our own machine and they are to be extended much further.

Our mission is to share this technological knowledge in an accessible and affordable way. We learned every single step ourselves and paid extra attention to re-writing and designing the manual in a kind, welcoming, and caring manner. The process of building a personal cloud was frustrating and painful even for us so we sought to tackle the elements that made this experience.

This involves detailed research on comfortable reading experience design for complicated concepts, metaphorical drawings that make us feel at ease learning, lightweight web development for sustainable web, and much more. Hope our gesture resonates with your adventure here.
